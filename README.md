# PyBer_Analysis
1.	Overview of the analysis

•	Purpose of the new analysis:
The purpose of this new analysis is to create a written report that summarizes how the PyBer ride-sharing data and total weekly fares differs by city type for 2019, and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. This analysis includes the summary DataFrame of ride sharing data by city type, and a multiple-line graph showing the total weekly fares for each city type, and was created using Pandas, Matplotlib and Python skills.

2.	Results
Using images and results from the summary DataFrame (see – Figure 1 below) and multiple-line chart (see – Figure 2 below), the following differences in PyBer’s ride-sharing data for 2019 among the different city types are noted:

•	The average fare per ride is lower in urban cities when compared to rural and suburban cities.
•	Rural cities record the highest average fare per ride. The summary DataFrame shows the average fare per ride in rural cities is $10 higher than is seen in urban cities. This may be accountable for the exceptionally low revenue and rides recorded by PyBer in rural cities.
•	There are more rides and drivers in urban cities. This could be attributable to the low fares in urban cities.
•	The largest portion of PyBer’s total revenue (approximately 62.7%) is generated from ridesharing in urban cities. This is expected since urban cities record the highest number of rides and drivers.
•	PyBer fares in rural cities peak in the month of April as seen in the multiple line graph.
•	PyBer fares in suburban and urban cities peak late February and early March.
•	The average fare per driver in rural cities is about 3.5 times more than the average fare per driver in urban cities. The high fares in the rural cities could be the reason for the low usage of PyBer ride sharing services in rural cities.
•	In conclusion, PyBer ride sharing operations do not appear consistent for the three cities. In the short term, PyBer may consider more ride sharing investments in urban and suburban cities as these cities generate significantly higher revenue than the rural cities operations. However, further analysis will be required, including review of prior years and other factors before the investment decisions can be finalized.

3.	Summary
The following are three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types:

a.	Based on the results of the analysis performed, rural cities only account for 125 rides which is 5.3% of PyBer’s total rides for the period analyzed (see -Figure 3 below). To encourage more ride sharing patronage which should also result in increased revenue from rural cities, PyBer should consider reducing the average fare per ride in rural cities to match average fare per ride in suburban cities or urban cities. This should also mitigate any risk of an oligopoly which drivers in rural cities may be enjoying.

b.	Based on the results of analysis performed, rural cities only account for 6.8% of PyBer’s total revenue or fares. Average fare per driver in rural cities is however significantly higher than in suburban and urban cities (3.5 times higher than the average fare per driver in urban cities). PyBer should consider regulating the average fare per driver by setting a standard fare per driver across cities. There should however be some flexibility to increase this by set percentages, for instance, in the case of a surge in ride request or during statutory holidays.

c.	Lastly, PyBer may consider shutting down operations in rural cities and investing more in the suburban and urban cities business since these generate more revenue. However, further analysis is required before a final decision can be made. This will include but is not limited to further analysis to determine the reason for low patronage and number of drivers in rural cities, and profitability of the rural cities’ operations despite low revenue.
